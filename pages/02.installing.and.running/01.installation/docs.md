# Setting up Mycroft

Currently, Mycroft only runs in Linux environments. If you already have a Linux desktop environment, you can go ahead and skip to the appropriate install section.



For those who use MacOS or Windows, you can use something like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) to set up a virtual Linux environment. To do this:
 - Install VirtualBox or another similar piece of software
 - Download an image of your preferred distribution of Linux from something like [osboxes.org](http://www.osboxes.org/). If you're not sure about distributions, we recommend using Ubuntu 16.04 as that is what our current setup scripts are targeted at.
 - Import your image into VirtualBox
