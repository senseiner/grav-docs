### `Regex`
The `regex` folder contains subfolders for each supported language, such as `en-us`. Inside of each of these subfolders are `.rx` files that contain regular expressions to create more flexible keywords for intents.
```
-regex
--en-us
---my.regex.rx
--pt-br
---my.regex.rx
```
As an example of how to use this, take a look at the [weather skill](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/tree/master/mycroft/skills/weather).  In the `regex/en-us` folder, there is a `location.rx` file that defines a regular expression for the group `Location`. It looks like this:
```
(at|in) (?P<Location>.*)
```
This can be hard to parse, especially for people who have never seen regular expressions before. Regular expressions are essentially formatted pieces of text that can be used to match a wide range of phrases or strings. The chunks of text inside parentheses are called capturing groups, and are used to group similar things. For example, `(at|in)` is a group that will match either the word `at` or the word `in`. The block `(?P<Location>.*)` is more complicated. Like `(at|in)`, it is also a capturing group. However, the `?P<Location>` syntax is used to give a name to whatever it captures, which is very useful for our purposes. In this case, it gives it the name `Location`. The following two characters, `.*`, are what are used to define what this group captures. The dot character, `.` can be used in regex to represent any character except for newlines. The `*` special character is used to repeat something zero or more times. So together, `.*` matches zero or more characters of any kind. This means that the regex `(at|in) (?P<Location>.*)` will match something like `in London`, as well as `at the corner store`. In the first case, the `Location` is London, and in the second, the `Location` is `the corner store`.
